SUPERVISED LEARNING AND ITS IMPORTANCE TO CANCER RESEARCH

 

Supervised learning is a sub-cateory of machine learning that uses data sets to train algorithms to classify data or to predict outcomes (IBM, n.d.). It is a branch of machine learning that is being used extensively in the cancer profession. Supervised learning is used to create models that help in the diagnosis, classification and progression prediction of different cancers by using clean datasets to train algorithms like linear regression, Naïve Bayes, and others (Wulczyn et al., 2020; Rani et al., 2016). Supervised learning has great potential to improve patient outcomes and advance personalized treatment in the cancer domain, as it is still one of the leading causes of death globally (WHO, 2022). In supervised learning, models are trained by using datasets. When fresh data is fed through the model, it can predict new outcomes by analyzing the variables and results in the training dataset. Supervised learning methods include neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees, and linear regression (Nasteski, 2017). Variables can be categorized and correlations between independent and dependent variables can be found using these algorithms.

The early diagnosis and classification of cancer forms is one of the most significant uses of supervised learning in cancer research. The identification and classification of cancer cells can be aided by supervised learning models that have been trained on big datasets of medical pictures and patient records (Sikder et al., 2021). In mammograms and other medical pictures, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a kind of supervised learning algorithm, have shown excellent accuracy in differentiating between benign and malignant cancers (Altameem et al., 2022). In order to find genetic alterations linked to various cancer types, supervised learning algorithms are helpful when evaluating genomic data (Lee, 2023). Researchers can predict how certain mutations affect cancer growth and treatment response by training algorithms using labeled genomic data. This is crucial for the development of medicines since knowledge of a tumor's genetic composition can inform individualized treatment regimens. It is possible to predict the toxicity and effectiveness of cancer treatments using supervised learning (Lippenszky et al., 2024). Models are able to anticipate how certain cancer cells would interact with potential medication candidates by examining datasets of chemical substances and their biological effects. This lessens the need for expensive and time-consuming laboratory testing and speeds up the medication development process (Osipova, 2024; Tilaoui et al., 2021).

The metabolic analysis of cancer spheroids treated with the monoclonal antibody Cetuximab is the subject of this case study by Hua et al. (2020). This study provides an example of the application of supervised machine learning in cancer research. The study used mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) data and the Aristotle Classifier (an advanced supervised learning tool) to classify and visualize the metabolic changes in spheroids at 24 and 72 hours post-treatment. After 72 hours, the data revealed notable metabolic alterations, indicating significant drug-induced modifications. At 24 hours, more moderate modifications were observed, which may possibly indicate the start of these changes. Our comprehension of drug-induced metabolic alterations in cancer spheroids has significantly improved thanks to supervised learning. This case study demonstrates how machine learning can improve the depth and accuracy of cancer research, paving the way for more specialized and potent cancer treatments.
